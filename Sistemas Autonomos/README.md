# Sistemas Autonomos Repository

## Project: Autonomous Systems Development with Robocode

**Description:**
This repository is dedicated to the development and programming of autonomous systems, with a special emphasis on constructing simulation processes for individual, group, and social behaviors within the Robocode programming environment.

**Project Objectives:**
- Motivate students for the development of autonomous systems.
- Emphasize programming and simulation of behaviors in the Robocode environment.

## About the Project

In this practical work, we aim to achieve the following key objectives:

- Autonomous Systems Development: Creating robots that operate independently within the Robocode environment.
- Behavior Simulation: Simulating individual, group, and social behaviors to understand their interactions.
- Programming Challenges: Solving tasks and challenges related to autonomous behavior and strategy.

## How to Use This Project

- The project includes Robocode robots, Java code, and simulation scenarios.
- You can access the Java code to analyze and modify the behavior of autonomous systems.
- Follow the provided instructions for setting up and running simulations within the Robocode environment.

## Prerequisites

- Java Development Kit (JDK)
- Robocode Environment (Download link: [Robocode Website](https://robocode.sourceforge.io/))
